### 🔥 What is DeepBlock?

**DeepBlock** is a real-time, intelligent firewall built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.  
It monitors network traffic, learns hacker behavior patterns, and evolves by retraining itself from live behavior logs.

You can think of it as a **self-learning AI security agent** — lightweight, beautiful, and powerful.
